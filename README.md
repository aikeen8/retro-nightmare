# Retro Nightmare

**Overview**
Retro Nightmare is a 2D atmospheric survival game developed in Unity. The project features precision-based flight mechanics, challenging players to navigate a hazardous environment. Inspired by the gothic horror aesthetic of *Bloodborne*, the game prioritizes endurance, where survival time—rather than distance—determines the score.

**Project Context**
This application was developed as a project for a Game Development course. It served as a practical exploration of the Unity Engine ecosystem, focusing on C# scripting, object-oriented programming, and 2D physics implementation.

**Key Features**
* **Physics-Based Movement:** Implemented custom gravity and impulse logic for character control.
* **Time-Based Scoring System:** Score is calculated dynamically based on player survival duration.
* **Collision Detection:** Precise hitbox management for player-versus-environment interactions.
* **Asset Management:** Utilization of Unity's asset pipeline for 2D sprites and UI elements.

**Tech Stack**
* **Engine:** Unity 2022
* **Language:** C#
* **IDE:** Visual Studio
